 question: Why does measuring voltage help you locate a burned out bulb? Try to answer in terms of electrical states, connections and/ or a gap.
 
 given information:

 reference: A zero voltage means that the terminals are connected. 		 answer: because no difference in the electrical states of two terminals in a connection is where the gap is. 
 score: incorrect 

 results:

 estimated similarity: [2.5605087] 		 estimated score: [1] 		 estimated mark: 5 
 
 given information:

 reference: A zero voltage means that the terminals are connected. 		 answer: there will be a gap between the positive battery terminal and the bulb terminal 
 score: incorrect 

 results:

 estimated similarity: [2.3404899] 		 estimated score: [1] 		 estimated mark: 4 
 
 given information:

 reference: A zero voltage means that the terminals are connected. 		 answer: an electircl aasoidrjf 
 score: incorrect 

 results:

 estimated similarity: [0.21556135] 		 estimated score: [1] 		 estimated mark: 0 
 
 given information:

 reference: A zero voltage means that the terminals are connected. 		 answer: a bulb causes a difference in electrical state 
 score: incorrect 

 results:

 estimated similarity: [1.4703401] 		 estimated score: [1] 		 estimated mark: 2 
 
 given information:

 reference: A zero voltage means that the terminals are connected. 		 answer: a gap causes a chemical reaction 
 score: incorrect 

 results:

 estimated similarity: [0.92418087] 		 estimated score: [1] 		 estimated mark: 1 
 
 given information:

 reference: A zero voltage means that the terminals are connected. 		 answer: Because when you measure the difference in electrical states of two terminals, if they are connected the reading will be 0.  If they are separated by a gap, the reading will be 1.5 V. 
 score: correct
