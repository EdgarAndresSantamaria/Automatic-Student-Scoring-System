# similarity_deep_model

This approach consists on a practical semantic similarity experiment in order to automatically grade students answers, the data could be found in https://www.kaggle.com/smiles28/semeval-2013-2-and-3-way , the only thing you should change over script are the paths in preprocess steps, then undestand the code in order to start fine tuning on your own parameters atack, it also offers some preprocess stages that we din't apply for time issues, but perfectly applicable.

Note: the model is dependent on external libraries that will be installed, so the first run may take a while on installing the dependencies.
